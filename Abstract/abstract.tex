Programming exercises used at school and in textbooks mostly focus on fundamental concepts, and lack reflections from real-world software development.
As a result, learners may not be able to achieve sufficient experience for practical software development from such learning materials.
We develop RealCode, a system that repurposes real issue and code diff data on GitHub to programming exercises.
Exercises in RealCode are intended to provide learning experience grounded to real-world projects.
We present our feasibility explorations, resulting in a decision tree for extracting GitHub issues appropriate for exercise use.
This paper also reports the prototype implementation as well as our informal qualitative study confirming unique benefits of RealCode exercises.
